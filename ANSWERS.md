1. Explain the difference between `RDBMS` and `SQL`.
   The relational database management system (RDBMS) is the actual place where the data is stored and the structured query language (SQL) is the language that allows us to interact with it.

1) Why do tables need a `primary key`?
   So there's a unique identifier for every piece of data. We need to be able to differentiate between every piece of data.

1. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
   Foreign Key

1. What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.
   A joint table is needed.
